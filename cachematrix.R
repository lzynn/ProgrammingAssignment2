## These functions are used for matrix inversion. 
## It is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix 
## rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will 
## not discuss here).

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## And it contains several functions:

## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
